# What We Have

# What We Can Do

- Correlation between video count and number of subscribers?
  - Plot scatterplot with best fit line
  - Conduct Pearson test

- Do large creators (lots of subscribers) have a higher average viewership than small creators?
  - Separate data into small and large creators
  - Plot histograms
  - Conduct t-test

# What We Need

- More data! Just need to add more youtube id's and call the API some more
- Might help to write a scraper to get youtuber's id's to supply to the API


# Meanings of Different Ratios

- Views/Subscriber: Outreach. High views/sub means you are reaching a much broader audience than your subscriber base. Low means your subscribers arent even watching.
- Subscribers/Video: Community Score. High subs/video means that you have a large community compared to the amount of content on your channel. Low means that you have a small community compared to the amount of content on your channel
- Views/Video: Average views that a YouTube video on the channel gets.
