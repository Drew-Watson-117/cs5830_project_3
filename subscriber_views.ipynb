    "This extended analysis of YouTube channels reveals significant insights into viewer engagement and content efficiency. By examining the views-to-subscriber ratio, we identify channels with highly engaged audiences. The histogram of the ratio distribution highlights the variance in engagement across channels, while the top 10 channels by this metric showcase those with exceptional performance. Furthermore, the scatter plot reveals the relationship between subscriber count and view count, underlining the diversity in strategies for achieving YouTube success. Overall, the analysis underscores the importance of creating content that resonates with and actively engages viewers.\n"
