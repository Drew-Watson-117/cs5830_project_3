    "The most obvious correlation to examine is that of average views per video and subscriber count. If channels with more subscribers do not average more views than channels with less subscribers, than getting more subscribers is not a meaningful way of maximizing a creator's revenue on the platform. If channels with more subscribers **do** average more views than channels with less subscribers, then trying to get more subscribers is a meaningful way of growing as a creator and making more money on the platform. To examine this relationship, we will first separate our dataset into \"small\" creators and \"large\" creators. This will simply be the creators with subscriber count below and above the median respectively. Then, we will plot the distributions of the average views per video, and compare them to see similarities and differences."

This is claim is further supported by a small p-value of 0.06, which though not technically statistically significant helps lend further credibility to the claim that large creators get more views per video than small creators.

    "The plot above shows that there is a positive correlation between average views per video and subscriber count. This makes sense because the more subscribers a channel has, the more people will be regularly consuming their content, and as a result their average views per video will increase. The p-value obtained by our Pearson test further supports this idea, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis. However, notice the channels with a low subscriber amount that have an enormous amount of views per video. These outliers are popular musicians, who unlike content creators have a small amount of videos. Each music video they post tends to go viral, and so their views per video are very high. Between the distribution plot showing us a significant difference in small and large creator's average views/video and the scatterplot showing us a positive correlation between average views/video and subscriber count, we claim that creators with more subscribers get more views than creators with less subscribers. We also claim that to maximize average views per video on a YouTube channel, it is a good idea to gain more subscribers."
