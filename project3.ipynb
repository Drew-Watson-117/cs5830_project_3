In this analysis, we aim to answer that question so that content creators can determine whether growing their subscriber base is a worthwhile endeavor for increasing average viewership, and subsequently profit. To do this, we will use a scatterplot for data visualization, along with linear regression to visualize possible correlation. We will also use a Pearson test to see if our results are statistically significant."

This makes sense because the more subscribers a channel has, the more people will be regularly consuming their content, and as a result their average views per video will increase. The p-value obtained by our Pearson test further supports this idea, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis. However, notice the channels with a low subscriber amount that have an enormous amount of views per video. These outliers are popular musicians, who unlike content creators have a small amount of videos. Each music video they post tends to go viral, and so their views per video are very high."

If the two are strongly correlated, then a good strategy to grow a YouTube channel would be to churn out a large quantity of videos. If they are weakly correlated or not correlated, it may not be so important for creators to be putting out a large quantity of videos.
