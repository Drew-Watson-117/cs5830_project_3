To do this, we will use a scatterplot for data visualization, along with linear regression to visualize possible correlation. We will also use a Pearson test to see if our results are statistically significant."

This makes sense because the more subscribers a channel has, the more people will be regularly consuming their content, and as a result their average views per video will increase. The p-value obtained by our Pearson test further supports this idea, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis. However, notice the channels with a low subscriber amount that have an enormous amount of views per video. These outliers are popular musicians, who unlike content creators have a small amount of videos. Each music video they post tends to go viral, and so their views per video are very high."

    "This extended analysis of YouTube channels reveals significant insights into content efficiency. By examining the views-to-subscriber ratio, we identify channels that successfully grasp the viewer's interest and gain subscribers based on that. The histogram of the ratio distribution highlights the variance in subscribers across channels, while the top 10 channels by this metric showcase those with exceptional performance. Furthermore, the scatter plot reveals the relationship between subscriber count and view count, underlining the diversity in strategies for achieving YouTube success. Overall, the analysis underscores the importance of creating content that resonates with and actively retains viewers and gains subscribers.\n"
